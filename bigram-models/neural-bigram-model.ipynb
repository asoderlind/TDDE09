    "The statistical bigram model is not very good at generating names. One way to improve it is to condition its probabilities on larger contexts beyond the immediately preceding character. However, this exponentially inflates the modelâ€™s parameter count. For instance, with a 51-character vocabulary, a statistical bigram model encompasses 2,601 probabilities, while a 3-gram model jumps to 132,651, and a 4-gram model has 6,765,201 probabilities.\n",

    "In this notebook we will build an alternative bigram model grounded in neural networks. Instead of relying on direct probability estimates, we will train a softmax classifier that predicts the succeeding character based on the preceding one. While this model does not outperform the statistical bigram model, it scales better to longer contexts and larger vocabularies. Additionally, the neural architecture offers greater flexibility."
